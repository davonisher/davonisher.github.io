# Hi, <br/> I'm David Kakanis.

### I'm a data analist with a focus on business.

### Currently, I help build [AI tool ranking], to help managers choose the right tool.

<br>

My life consists of programming, doing sports, reading and building stuff.
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
