thrust of the 3-3-3 Method is that every working day, Burkeman says, he will:

- "Spend **three hours on my most important current project,** having defined some kind of specific goal for the progress I aim to make on it that day"
    
- "Complete **three shorter tasks,** usually urgent to-dos or 'sticky' tasks I've been avoiding, usually just a few minutes each (I count calls and meetings here too)"  
    
- "Dedicate time to **three 'maintenance activities,'** things that need my daily attention in order to keep life running smoothly"
